# Weather_Query_Application

For this assignment, we have been tasked with creating a website (browser?) that displays the current weather/the forcast for the next five days, at the desired city the user chooses

## Day One

Today, I figured the first step would be just to set up the HTML and CSS files that I'll be working with. Since the first of my two HTML's are pretty plain, it would make a good jumping-off point to start!

## Day Two

Today I've been working on the fetching aspect of the page. It was a little confusing, but i was able to make it so that:

    --Through one API (Geocoding via openweathermap.org), I was able to get a set of coordinates via city input.
    --I then take those values and run them through another openwethermap.org API (One Call API), which then spits out all of the weather data.

Now, I need to figure out a way to append this information to my webpage, as well as save some weather info for persistent data...
